    "### Building probabilities of note sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Different algorithms exist for automatically composing music, usually involving randomness and probabilities. We will use a relatively simple approach called a [Markov model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model). This is a probability model where the probability of a note depends on the previous note. In other words, for every pair of notes, we have a *conditional probability* of one note conditioned on the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do these probabilities come from? We can calculate them from an existing sequence of notes. For example, in the sequence in the `pyknon` cell above, E4 is followed by E4 once, followed by C8 once, and followed by G2 once. So the conditional probabilities would be estimated as: $P(E4|E4)=\\frac{1}{3}, P(C8|E4)=\\frac{1}{3}, P(G2|E4)=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function below takes a note sequence (written as a string) as input and calculates the conditional probabilities as they appear in the sequence. It returns a dictionary containing the conditional probabilities. You can then use this dictionary in combination with the `sample` function defined at the start of this notebook to randomly sample notes according to these probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to understand the structure of the dictionary used in this code. It is a nested dictionary (dictionary within a dictionary) that has two levels. The keys of the first level indicate the first note, and the keys of the second level indicate the next note. Thus, `cond['E4']['C8']` contains the value of $P(C8|E4)$."
